"Now that's downright embarrassing." â€” Sniper

## Brain Outside My Head

I expect people I know to read this blog at some point, probably when they first meet me or later on. So, I write my posts like how Thoreau wrote *Walden*: without anything negative. 

Boston is hot as hell in the summer and cold as penguin land in the winter. He was probably getting bit by bugs all day with sore muscles and various infections. So, the book isn't an accurate picture of what his life was actually like. You could call it obscuring reality, but I would say that he gave us the slice of his life he wanted to see, and that's ok. 

If you really did want to know what my life was like, you could just follow me around everywhere. But at that point, you aren't living your life anymore, you're just shadowing someone else. It seems like the more of people's lives that can be directly transmitted to others' brains, the less people actually live their own. Enjoying other people's content is like eating carrots: eat a few, better vision; eat too many, you turn orange. 

## Red Like the Sun, or Hemoglobin

I still get really embarrassed when people play my songs in front of me, and I think I will always be like that, though I might handle it differently eventually. What am I supposed to do when that happens? First step would be to find my true objective, so what I do has to be situational. 

I also shared my YouTube channel with my math teacher last year. He watched the cringiest video ever posted, which was a math parody of the old Ryan Higa conspiracy theory parody videos on April Fools' Day. I said I should probably take that down, but he said it was pretty funny. After that, I didn't really worry too much about people watching my videos. 

Occasionally though, a group of 5+ classmates start opening up my channel during some break in class, which is a good motivation for me to learn Manim so that I can stop making those garbo *MS Paint* videos. Sure, it's organic, but insofar as organic vegetables have a bunch of holes in them. 

## People Change

My opinions are constantly changing on many things. For example, the statistics teacher that I did not think highly of, at first, turned out to be a great teacher after just a few days. So, if you perceive something that I write about you as negative, there's a good chance that my mind has changed. If you were to confront me about whatever was written in the past, I would be totally honest about the journey of my opinions. 

Also, any "insults" I make are probably just jokes in good faith. 

I probably should not have to explain these things, but different people perceive text differently, and my words should be as well-articulated as possible to not confuse or offend the people who happen to see things that way. This is to no fault of their own. People set boundaries depending on many factors and articulators should take that into account when discussing anything with strangers. I learned these things from KiNG Nidhogg, by the way, who I view as a very insightful person.
