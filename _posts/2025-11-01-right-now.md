## Deja Vu
In HK I was shocked by Shek O Beach because I saw a scene straight out of an art book from a middle school art class. The rocks, beach, and coastline looked exactly the same as a drawing I did back then. 

It was kind of magical until I realized that there's probably hundreds of coastlines just like the one at Shek O with big red rocks and a mountain on the right side of the ocean. 

### DJ Vu
My friend T was hosting DJ lessons for everyone who was interested in DJing for Ravery and I signed up for a quick lesson

## Hollow Knight
is a great game that is quite difficult for people who are not used to movement-based games, but once you figure out how to pogo[^1], it becomes very fun. 

The music and art are also amazing, and I really appreciate the cute/creepy insect aesthetic.

### Cornifer

## Silksong
felt a bit more clunky when getting started, but I eventually got used to the movement. 

### Old Habits
I seem to explore more than I'm supposed to and end up going into late-game fights when I'm severely undergeared. For example, I went to fight some ants, which was one of the most terrifying things ever.

They all have their own complex attack/dodge patterns, even though they aren't boss mobs, and also take 20 hits to defeat without any damage upgrades. 

This also happened when I played the prev game because I would find bosses before I found any upgrades, like there was some kind of jumping spider that also spit lava which took me about 20 attempts, and I don't think there was even a good reward after that. 

### New Habits
I've been trying to do 100 push-ups and 100 squats every day and it's gone decently well so far, since I feel much more healthy every day.

I even set up a website to let me keep track of it, where I have a counter for how many glasses of water I've drank so far, and whether I've played guitar/drawn/written. 

## Down with the Sickness
I may have mentioned this before, but since I don't get sick that often, I get nostalgic about the last time I was sick, which was right after I got back from Japan last spring. 

My hypothesis is that it has something to do with the loss of smell and the way that memories and smells are intertwined. 

### Orange Car
I visited Prof. W's house and they have 3 very nice cats. The orange cat seemed to really like me because it kept coming up to smell me. However, I was too engrossed in eating chocolate chip cookies to pick it up. Maybe next time.

## Intentions
Is it immoral to do laundry on weekdays?
