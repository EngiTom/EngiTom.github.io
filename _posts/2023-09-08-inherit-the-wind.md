"If the result is all that matters to you, you start taking shortcuts. And when you take shortcuts, you start to lose sight of the truth." â€” Abbacchio's partner

## Vlog channel
There are many college vlog channels on YT and I've watched a few of them, subsequently thinking about whether I should also become one of them. However, I just feel like it would be tedious to record everything that happens in real life and then upload it. It seems like the act of recording would make things very awkward. 

### Reaction Videos
I've always found reaction channels fun to watch, but realized that recording them is just an insane concept. 

When people are on camera, they will naturally react more expressively than they would normally. This was brought to my attention when I saw an Instagram reel of a woman shaking on her bed while talking about how she reacted to her breakup. Next, a guy reenacted what she had to do to create that video, which was to calmly set up a camera pointed at her bed and then she had to scream and shake around.

This is also why I didn't want to do a college decision reveal because it would obviously just be an example of what I just described. 

## Go Ahead
Warning: some spoilers for JoJo part 4 and 5

I watched all of part 4 and 5 because, previously, I had only seen them in memes, though I did get a general idea of what both were about from their memes, I decided that it would be better to enjoy them in their original form.

### Diamond is Mohs Hardness 10
It's hard to say which one I like more, but the main difference is that the latter has much more complicated fights and stand abilities. Before, it was mostly revolved around typical fight scenes; however, part 5 brings a lot of Detective Conan/Sherlock Holmes elements into the fights. Every fight is about figuring out how to counter the enemy stand in a creative yet logical way. This tracks with how the characters' bodies became less muscular as time went on in the series. 

However, another difference I noticed is that Kira, the antagonist of Morioh, feels more threatening than the one in part 5. I think Kira might be one of the most interesting villains in anime because of his character. Diavolo attempts to recreate his weirdness with the dual personality gimmick and the imaginary phone, but it doesn't stick as well as Kira's authentic psycho behavior. 

That being said, the supporting cast of part 4 is superior in my opinion because of Rohan and Koichi having many sideplots to develop their personalities, such as Rohan's battle against Highway Star. In contrast, the team in part 5 moves in unison; so, even though each of the characters have their own backstory, their job seems more like protecting the payload.

Furthermore, I find the mix between mystery and action to be perfectly balanced in part 4, since the fights are much more tangible. For instance, when Josuke is fighting Yoshikage at the end, he shoots homing pieces of glass out the window with his ability, which is just such a creative way to use the ability to restore objects. In essence, it feels much less like the excessively information-based fights of part 5. 

However, my fav part of part 4 was definitely Jotaro and Koichi's fight against Kira when they first uncover his identity. I'm pretty sure it was the beginning of all the body-temperature tracking stands.
