"A sense of reality breathes life into a piece of work, and goes hand in hand with entertainment." â€” Kishibe Rohan

## Moving Out and In
Since I am moving across the country, I need to pack some things. However, I can get many of the required items delivered to my brother via Amazon. 

### 5th Year
School actually starts very late, so I could visit my high school one last time before I go at the start of the school year. DMO actually thought I already left which means it will be really funny when I show up to class for the 13th time. 

### Fans
I heard from my friend that people were fangirling over me in Calc BC, which is pretty funny because the combination of verb and location is just very unusual. 

It turns out that half the class have been in classes that I've visited before. A very nice student E complimented my singing and said that I have "NO" nerfs.

Then, the teacher pulled up my LinkedIn for some reason (on the projector???) and scrolled through. My friend M who told me about this was asked if he knows me, and he simply said, "Yeah I know him." LOL

## Antibodies Want to Rule the World
My research is coming to an end and there are a lot of lessons I learned. 

1. If you notice a bug or some overlooked detail in the code that has already been run, fix it immediately rather than waiting. I didn't realize that I was only checking for extraneous amino acid codes in intraactions and not in interactions. So, the pool of intraactions was actually larger than it should have been. 
2. Put clear comments in the code and outline the purpose of every cell.
3. Write some general pseudocode before attempting to code a new technique.
4. Ensure that an outsider can run the notebook sequentially to reproduce results with no error. 

### Perfect is the enemy of good enough
In a recent talk with my dad's friend, he mentioned that part of what is learned in college is that being a perfectionist is not necessarily better than stopping a project once it is good enough. This made a lot of sense to me because the marginal gain of spending more time on an almost-perfect project diminishes greatly. And that time would be better spent working on something new. 

## Hacked by random latino
This is actually one of the funniest things that has happened to me in a while.

One day I could not login to Spotify anymore, and I assumed it was because I had forgotten my password or something, but it was actually because I got hacked. I couldn't send an email to reset my password because my email was actually changed (I did not know that at the time).

### Crazy Noisy Bizarre Support
At the time, I thought I would need to get access to my QQ Mail account. QQ Mail is a Chinese email service which I was not able to access since 2019 because my Chinese phone number no longer works (because I live in America). 

Eventually, I got access to my QQ Mail after a long session with the support people. Then, I couldn't receive a reset email, which I thought was because QQ cannot get emails from Spotify, but it was probably because the person who got my account logged in with the email and password and then changed the email and password from within Spotify, because he definitely didn't have access to my email if even I didn't have access.

Then, I actually got through to the Spotify support staff through that stupid chat window. It's kind of like the modern version of how companies will put you on with the automated robot and then make you press five buttons before you can talk to a real person. 

Anyway, I sent a pic of my bank statement, reset my email and password, and got access to my account. 

### Interesting taste
Turns out, my hacker liked to listen to Latin rap. More specifically, an artist named Reykon. 

It seems like it's an individual who stole my account and not a collective because they played a few songs from different artists. There's no real way to know, but nothing bad happened to my playlists, which is nice. 

His favorite song is "Medayork" by Reykon, Hamilton, and Dimeloking:

### Lesson learned
It's just so funny that someone would log into someone else's account just so they could listen to a few of their favorite songs without ads playing. 

As it turns out, having a password with no special characters and two quadruple-repeated letters and numbers is not a good idea, in the format of AAAABBBB. There are actually algorithms that try repeated character combinations, which would explain how I got hacked. 

But anyway, Spotify should really add two-factor, since that would stop people from making new accounts and getting free trials. Also, it would have made stealing my account harder. 

Also, Latin rap isn't half bad!
