"The best part of the game is the journey." â€” Ryan Higa

In this post, I will choose my words to illustrate how I feel and portray the situation objectively. 

## Loss
I recently lost a friend who I thought I was close with. Loss can happen in many ways, but it never feels good. My loss is a very common type, ghosting. 

It is cruel, though not more than other types of loss, it still doesn't feel good. It's cruel because I am left to pick up pieces of the puzzle and conjure up a reason, rather than have it communicated to me. 

I will never get an answer from anyone directly, but here is a general rule: we were never that close. 

When I go back and look at the logs, all I see is small talk, and mostly from me. Sometimes the wait would be many weeks. There would always be some sort of excuse, and I believed it and moved on. I believed that this return would continue to happen because I concluded that I should just trust every time after doubting the return every time. 

### Unmotivated
Afterward, I felt unmotivated to do any work. On an emotional level, if I am not healthy, then I cannot do anything. I started listening to some sad songs which made me feel worse, but it seemed like the way that I should be feeling, deserve to be feeling in that situation. 

I realized that this type of music is really meaningless, though it is full of emotion and can make the minds of people feel the contents of the music. The songs seem to be manipulative in a way, not teaching people how to get better, just keeping them in that state of heartbreak. The lyrics were either written by people who cannot handle their own emotions, or people who know how to control the emotions of others. 

So, I thought about the stuff I wrote in the previous section and whether my emotional state is justified. My diagnosis was that I really just lost someone who I would just chat about boring stuff with, and that it really wasn't such a big deal, since that relationship can be made with anyone. 

However, I thought that the ending was not good, kind of like *Solo Leveling*'s ending, so I tried my best to change it. 

### Communication
I wanted to give my old friend the chance to communicate, even if it's just for the last time. From this, maybe we could become better friends. 

At this point, it isn't about getting over negative emotions, just about finding a way to move on with no regrets. 

The first part is the hard part though. With someone who doesn't even want to spend the effort of explaining to me why they don't want to talk anymore, it is really hard to make them open up. If the relationship was never even that valuable, why would they want to be better friends?

So, I just sent out a big blob and left it there. A friend of a friend tells me that the regret is starting to sink in for them, so just let that do what it will. 

### Blame
Do not blame anyone for what happens, because people make the choices they make due to their personality, their circumstances, and their values. For example, if someone is really busy, they can't really control that directly. Or, if someone is afraid of confrontation, then it is either overcome personally, or will never change. 

In my case, if I did not do enough to open up in the beginning of the relationship and become better friends, I cannot change the past, so the best thing to do is to remember that mistake and grow from it. 

## Growth
I think I've come out of this feeling a lot more mature and in control of my emotions. 

If it were to happen to me again, I would not be upset or place blame; I would just keep learning and be content with that. 

### How to wait
You may be wondering how long to wait for someone. The answer is a bit complicated.

Essentially, just wait passively, meaning to not have any expectations, since anything could happen. 

This requires patience, but you should move on with what is happening in your life and find something else to fill your time. Things that do not happen cannot be forced, and things that do happen will happen. As for an individual's abilities to impact those events, it's enough and should only be enough to provide a road to walk down. 

If you believe that you will never be the same, you are right. But, as VSauce said, a person is like a tree: a scar may last forever, but we can grow to make that scar a smaller part of ourselves. 

I must comment on Robert Frost, because even though I could not see both paths to the end and be one traveler, I am content with being able to be myself at this fold in the page.
