SPOILER ALERT!

## My Theories

So, there are a number of mysteries surrounding *Link Click* and the second season. I do not know what happens in the next season, but based on everything from episode 1 to 11, I have made a few guesses as to what might happen based on the clues that we were given. 

## Villain Identity

At the end of episode 11, someone takes control of Qiao Ling and stabs and kills Lu Guang, takes control of the secretary girl and jumps off the bridge, and takes control of the CEO's son and strangles himself with the handcuffs (which was probably stopped by the police). 

This person is definitely the focal point of the next season and is a massive cliffhanger that brings a lot of interesting ideas into the mix, so here are some of my ideas on who it might be. 

### Parent Arc Clue

When the dad was talking about how someone known as "Dashi," or Master/Sensei, was the one who told him about the proper fengshui (a kind of decoration theory in Chinese culture that is supposed to bring good fortune to a business) for the boba shop and what to name his son, Doudou, he never explains who that actually is. 

The villain may be or may be affiliated with this so-called Dashi. This could also be a red herring though.

### Police Officers

It might actually be the chief detective or his assistant, because we know that since Chen Xiaoshi has to see an image to go into it, the only person who can access the footage of the day that the secretary jumped off would be a police officer. 

However, if the person is not restrained by the use of images, then it becomes much more difficult to figure out. 

### Crime Organization

Because of how some criminal with chloroform was stopped by Chen Xiaoshi when he was supposed to be listening to one guy's confession to the girl, the villain may be a part of the same criminal organization, but this is probably not true because it was explained that she became a target as a result of being seen online. 

## Force of Nature and Origin of Powers

So, we actually have no idea how these two got their powers in the first place, especially Lu Guang, who has nothing mentioned about his childhood or family. We do know that Chen Xiaoshi's parents went somewhere, but they probably won't become a major part of the story. 

Let's go back to that and first establish some observations about this villain's powers:

First of all, this person can take over multiple different people's bodies at the same time, three is the current known number here. Secondly, when the CEO's son was battling Chen Xiaoshi in the darkroom of the photography studio, it seemed like it was a different person behind the mask. They seemed intrigued by how Chen Xiaoshi had to clap his hands to go into the photo. Thirdly, the CEO's son asks his "friend" to "kill these insects" for him, suggesting that his friend has some strange abilities. Fourthly, at the end, when Chen Xiaoshi goes back to the real world after Qiao Ling kills Lu Guang, Qiao Ling says, "The game has reset," a callback to when Chen Xiaoshi said, "Game over," in the darkroom. 

So, this leads us to believe that this figure's powers are definitely stronger than Chen Xiaoshi's. They could be the result of a disturbance in space-time, which would be a reasonable explanation because that would explain how Lu Guang and Chen Xiaoshi got their powers. Potentially, two people were given time-travelling powers by something, but it turned out that the protagonists split the power between them while the villain has both of their powers combined. 

### Heartseed

It could be similar to Heartseed from *Kokoro Connect*, where it's just some supernatural intelligent creature that can possess other creatures. Its origin might be the disturbance in the universe caused by Chen Xiaoshi changing the past. In a sense, it could be like a guardian of some sort that balances out the chaos they have caused. 

## Lu Guang Dead?

As a protagonist, Lu Guang is probably going to revive or be brought back in some way. I am interested in seeing *how* the writers are going to do that though, because it seems like killing Lu Guang is a move that puts them in a hole. It could be some stupid new concept like giving Lu Guang powers, or something that conforms to what the audience could know if they used all the information available. 

I honestly would expect Lu Guang to gain powers because of how strange his past is. No one actually knows what will happen though.

The worst case in the plot is that Lu Guang is just the future Chen Xiaoshi coming back in time as a more mature person, but this is actually way too crazy to be true.
