## RamYUM
Ate ramen late at night with E, R, and W.

### CUCers
Hosted two Caltech Up Close (CUC) students in the triple, it's kind of annoying to host them but we do get $20 dollars per roommate per CUC student. 

This year, they were quite respectful and nothing out of the ordinary happened. I forgot it was this early in the year and I definitely should not have hosted CUCers last year. 

### Roomies
E and R are my roommates this year. I don't remember when we met last year, but it was probably at dinner. 

### Tips 4 Ever
S is a frosh who told me and J that she had some trouble completing her work the first week of school because she went to study groups with 10+ people! 

She realized that's a massive mistake, so she worked alone. However, that's also a big mistake because working alone is also worse than working with others. 

**4 people** is the optimal group size.

## RDRN?
One time at 12 AM, E said, "RDRN?"

Apparently, that means "Red Door right now?" So, I say it all the time.

We and other students have found it very annoying to type RDRN to every other friend over text, so E and I had the idea of making an app that allows you to press a single button and notify all friends that you want to go to RDRN.

### React
So, I've been trying to code an app with the following features:
1. Sign-in with Google
2. Add friends by search
3. Notify friends with button

This seems very simple, but it's actually been quite hard because I can't find any examples of exactly what I want online. 

We decided to use React Native instead of Flutter, but React is quite annoying because everything is built on packages and the code becomes just managing dependencies. 

Hopefully it works out though.
