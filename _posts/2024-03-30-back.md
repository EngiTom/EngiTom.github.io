## Order of Magnitudes
If you stand on a scale with a cup of water and start drinking, the scale will read the same number.

This was a small shower thought I had last night and I started wondering if I could measure something interesting using a scale and a cup of water.

### Grams per gulp
I wanted to see how many gulps of water it would take until the reading on the electronic scale changed. 

After I took 40 gulps, that's when my mass went up by 300 grams, or 0.3 kg. Now, there could be some error here, but it wouldn't change the result too much because of how many gulps I took. If I took a smaller number of gulps and it changed readings quickly, the error would be huge. 

### Unit definition
The cool thing about metric units for volume and mass is that one liter of water is almost exactly one kg of water under normal conditions.

Also, a squared meter is equal to 1000 liters. 

### Gulping the oceans
I looked up how much water there is in the ocean, and I got 1.33 billion cubic km. Then, I converted cubic km to cubic deciliter which is the same as liter.

So, I multiplied by $(10^4)^3$ which gave me $1.33 * 10^21$ L. 

Finally, if you multiply by 40 gulps and divide by 0.3 L, it means that it will take $1.78 * 10^23$ gulps to drink the entire ocean. 

### Do your part!
Dividing by the total population of Earth[^1], which is 8 billion, and got that everyone would need to take $2.2 * 10^11$ gulps over their lifetime. 

Given the average life expectancy, which is around 73 years, or around 2.3 billion seconds, everyone has to take around 100 gulps per second in order to drink the whole ocean in a single human lifetime.

This model does not account for excretions, but let's just say that eventually, everyone will end up like Friedrich Wöhler.[^2]

### Order up!
Mr. J, my old chem teacher, really values these kinds of calculations and was glad to hear during my recent visit that Caltech teaches order-of-magnitude estimates.

He calls them Fermi calculations, based on the way that physicist Enrico Fermi used multiple factors and multiplied them together to make estimations.

I used to think that this was the only example of a Fermi estimate, but the most famous example is the Drake equation, which can be used to estimate the number of intelligent alien civilizations in the universe.[^3] This is one of the ways to guess at the solution to the Fermi paradox.

### tan(Fermi)
It's funny just how much talent was shifted away from Europe just because of the oppression faced by people of various ethnicities during the WW2 era. 

Fermi and Einstein are good examples, but I wonder if the same is happening today or will happen in the future. 

### Scoring
This sort of dimensional analysis can help with creating scoring methods for various algorithms. For example, deciding when to divide or multiply by a value.
