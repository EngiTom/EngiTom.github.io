## Broken Blog
So, I think there was some kind of SSL error with my blog and I had to ask ChatGPT and Github Copilot a lot of questions because I have no idea what's going on with these processes. 

## Coursework
- ACM 104: Applied Linear Algebra
- ACM 116: Probability Models
- BEM 109: Finance of China
- BEM 131: International Trade
- CS 164: Compilers

I was thinking about taking Ph/CS 219: Quantum Computing this spring with John Preskill. According to M, there's no need to take quantum mechanics before quantum computing, so I'll just do it since I took too many of the spring term ML courses already. 

Also, one of my friends T is interested in the content of 219 since she's in quantum computing at a different school, so it would be interesting to see if there are any differences. 

## DJ School
T, one of my good friends and amazing DJ, was giving a mini-class on how to DJ. 

Essentially, DJs are trying to combine two songs in a nice way and transition between them until the event is over. 

Me, A, V and some of the underclassmen were learning and at the end we tried to do our own transitions which went quite poorly, but then T showed us how it's actually done, which was very impressive. 

### Round and Round
Before that, there was rotation, which was a lot of fun this year and I helped organize some of the events for Avery House. 

At karaoke, I was running the table and was completely overwhelmed and had a terrible time. I believe the word is "crashout."

Normally, T would be there to help run it, but I was operating the table basically by myself and had to do three things simultaneously:

1. Turn off the mics of the screamers, which requires quite a bit of testing
2. Control the volume of the music and mics
3. Take song requests and queue new songs

This doesn't sound too complicated, but trying to do it yourself for the first time is a very stressful process. 

### Reflection
When I was taking a shower that night, I thought about why I was feeling like shit, and realized that it was basically just in my head. 

Instead of being angry at the people screaming into the mics, I should just relax and have fun instead. It's all about attitude. 

### Laggy
When I came back to campus, my sleep was only about 7 hours per night, but I felt amazing waking up every single day. 

In fact, I was extremely upbeat to a strange degree the morning after the shower. I was talking very fast and making a lot of jokes.

I'm not sure what happened, but by week 3 of class, that attitude was completely gone. I now need to sleep 9 hours like I did before and I always feel some kind of pressure. 

In some ways, that felt like I was burning away my lifeforce in exchange for that kind of attitude. It felt inorganic, like the positivity was just swelling out of me. 

### Deserved
I don't think it's sustainable to feel that enlightened state forever. But I think it's possible to move in that direction slowly over time.
