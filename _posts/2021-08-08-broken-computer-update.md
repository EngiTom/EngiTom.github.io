Hello everyone, I'm just going to write a short status update on what I have been doing.

Basically, my PC is broken, so I am just using my laptop now. I usually write from Visual Studio Code, but I am just writing from the Github website today. I really do not want to write blogs from my laptop because it is so annoying. Also, the week of August 9th is going to be pretty busy so don't expect anything before Saturday. 

The PC broke because I was trying to clean it, but I probably touched the motherboard at some point which damaged it. I actually did not have a lot of knowledge on computer hardware when I did that, but I've been doing a lot of research and now I kind of know the right way to do things. Static electricity, even if it is just from the body, can damage the motherboard. If you have an old one, then it might just break like mine. 

Since I can't really use my computer though, I decided to just do all my summer homework before school starts. Our school is going back near the end of this month anc I am pretty excited because I am not really able to use my time well right now, and I guess a goal of mine for next summer would be to be productive even though I have the ability to not be. There are so many projects which I have started and never finished even though it would probably only take one day if I started after breakfast. 

## Ideas
Of course, I can't just end this without revealing some plans I have. 

Firstly, let me just say that everyone should write down ideas on paper whenever they appear in order to not forget them. I have forgotten ideas so many times because I did not bother to write them down, but then became really irked by the fact that I can't actually remember it. Also, remember to sleep early because memory is heavily affected by sleep. So many of my friends say they have a bad memory but also sleep at 2 AM every day. 

So, with that out of the way, here are some ideas that I have:

1. Comparing Craigslist to other social mediums and how a platform's features can affect the mannerisms of the people on it.
2. Word density and how it can reveal information about a text. 
3. Subtle truths that are more easily demonstrated with increased sample sizes (such as more doors in the Monty Hall problem).
4. Simple solutions to complex problems (adding a CAPTCHA to TF2 so that the bots can't queue).
5. Different types of ranking systems in win-lose games, such as Elo, winrate, total wins, TrueSkill, DWZ. 
6. Misguided visions of math in high school (the history of how calculus became the final boss).
7. More fun mobility mechanics in TF2 (Beggar's Bazooka, Force-A-Nature). 
8. Music production (I have been learning a little bit).

Those are all the ideas I could think of for now. Thanks for reading! :)
