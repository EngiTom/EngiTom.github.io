## City of Gold
People like to take photos during golden hour, which usually right before the sunset.

The last few days in Pasadena, every hour of sunlight has been golden hour. 

Sometimes, it even snows. Ashes, but still pretty. 

### First Snow
Starting on Tuesday 7th, massive gusts of wind woke me up and there were torrents of leaves flying past my window. 

Later, when I went to class, I thought it was a bit chilly and I talked to J about it. He said that we should definitely ask M, a friend who is quite the expert in meteorology. 

M said it was just the Santa Ana winds.

### Second Wind
Apparently, there were 60 mph winds coming down the mountain from the north. Naturally, this knocked over a few power lines and caused some fires.

At some time after dinner ~18:30, it smelled like grill night but it was unclear where the smell was from, but I could see some smoke in the north. 

This was apparently the start of the Eaton Fire which spread east and west in Altadena around 8 miles and north and south 5 miles, covering 10.6k acres by the 8th, then 13.7k and 14k the following days. 

I asked my brother whether the fires would reach the school and he replied that it was impossible because there just aren't enough trees for the fire to jump to. 

However, if the wind picks up again like it's expected to, things may actually get really bad. 

### Crowd Control
At Caltech, most people have left to the south in Irvine or Orange County. Some people have even escaped to the Bay Area or the east coast.

The main reasons to escape include the uncertainty of water contamination and air pollution as a result of burning buildings with asbestos, benzene, lead, and all sorts of delicious chemicals.

In the midst of the chaos, there have been lootings and even more arson. While the cause of the big fires are unknown, it may be a mix of arson and the wind. 

Incredibly, E ordered a lot of masks the day before the fire simply because he doesn't like to wear sunscreen. Thanks to that, we had masks immediately when we needed it. 

## Fourth Wall
Typically hiding behind a screen whenever there are bad things happening in the news, I've actually gone to the other side, a victim of nature's plot. 

If you look at an aerial photo of the Pacific Palisades, it appears to be as bad as various warzones. As a longtime player of *Enlisted*, the scenes reminded me of France from WW2 with buildings stripped to the bone. 

### Arcanist
Some student took an amazing photo from the top floor of Caltech Hall and it looks exactly like Heimerdinger's memory of the world collapsing from people using magic.

## How to survive the apocalypse
1. Get some bottled water
2. Wear a mask
3. Don't go outside

This is sounding an awfully lot like 2020 all over again, huh?
