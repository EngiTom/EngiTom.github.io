## Resolutions
I wanted to check if I fulfilled my 2024 resolutions but for some reason, I didn't write any for 2024, 2023, or 2022 on the blog. Anyway, it's time to look forward.

### Making a list
My 2025 New Years Resolutions are as follows:
- Watching less reels and YouTube and Webtoons ðŸ˜”
- Learn something new and meaningful every day
- 100 pushups, 100 situps, and 100 squats every day
- Healthy sleep schedule

I think this is a solid short list of things I can reasonably accomplish. It's short so I can always remember and it's mostly under my control. 

It's also a list that naturally blends into other goals like not being on a screen all the time. To learn something new that's meaningful, maybe I'll read a book or an article instead of watching reels. 

### Checking it twice
Entertainment is just a kind of dopamine shot, and if those shots all come from consuming useless content, it will crowd out space for useful things. 

To accomplish my exercise goal, I'll need to take a break from whatever it is that I'm doing at regular intervals, which would help me stand up more. It would also help reset my mind which does too much thinking. 

I haven't set up any punishment because I hope that these things will become habits and eventually a part of me. There doesn't need to be an external punishment for not being me. 

### Project goals
I have some projects I would like to get done this year:
- Fun machine learning application
- Fully produced song
- VSauce-style YT video
- Mobile app available for download
- At least one blog post per month

Some of these may need to take place during the summer but I plan to incorporate some of them into my daily routine as well.
