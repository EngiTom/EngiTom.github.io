"Pursue excellence, and success will chase you... pants down." â€” Rancho, *3 Idiots* (2009)

## What matters?
Before applying to college, you should have an idea of what you want and what is possible. I'm not sure who is reading this so I will try to make it general for each year in high school.

I am operating under the assumption that the reader wishes to go to the *most prestigious* institution that they are capable of going to. Of course, this is all part of the game of college played by society. Moving past all of that, here are the topics covered: 

- Things to do before applying (by grade)
- Getting letters of recommendation
- Writing essays

## Rule 1: Remember the Human
Remember that the admissions staff is a person. 

Students sometimes forget that college admissions is simply the student writing things on paper and handing it to admissions officers (AOs) who read it and report based on it. 

With this in mind, there are certain priorities that can be set when writing an application.

## Stacking the Brag Sheet
Every student applies using their stats, which are things including clubs, volunteering, sports, competitions, awards, honors, research, projects, etc. 

The main goal is to just max out the stats so that you have at least ten things to put on a list. Most people who get into the better schools do not have ten things of the same quality, maybe just a few that are really good. There is a preference for specialists, because there are only a few people who are perfect at everything. If you are such a person, no need to keep reading, just keep doing everything perfect. 

### Time Management
It's up to you how much time you want to spend on leisure and how much you want to spend on work during high school. But, beginning with an average week of 168 hours, taking away 56 hours of sleep, 21 hours of eating and using the bathroom (separately, of course), we are left with 91 hours in a week, setting aside 40 hours of school per week (we will return to it later), we have 51 hours available for work and play.

Before deciding how to cut it up, let's say that every normal person takes breaks from working for at least one hour a day, leaving us with 44 hours in total to work. 

### Reporting Hours
On your college application, you must list the hours you spend on each activity. If the total sum goes over or even close to 40, it is extremely suspicious. 

If you are actually spending that much time, then you may want to consider underreporting to avoid doubt. On the theme of remembering the person reading is a human, there's no point in overreporting because no AO is reading for a student's hours spent doing something, it's just extraneous information that they ignore when they read so many applications a day. 

### Time Management Cont.
Personally, I like to spend an average of about 2-3 three hours a day doing something for fun that isn't related to work. If you have something that appears productive that you also find fun (or vice versa), such as drawing or playing an instrument, it can be an efficient way to spend time. 

However, from my experience writing about guitar and my YouTube channel, the admissions staff at Caltech really did not care about either one. Hobbies are more like something in the background of your personality from the perspective of an AO. 

That doesn't mean you shouldn't have any though, because if Bob Ross didn't cover the background with Phthalo blue before starting, it would look really weird.

Anyway, say you spend 2 hours a day on fun things and you are left with 37 hours a week to do work/extracurriculars. 

### Studying
Obviously, some time is required to do HW and study for classes outside of school. It depends on your workload, but I remember never really spending more than 2-3 hours a day on HW unless I had a project. So, let's say 10 hours a week on HW, and maybe 2 hours studying? I'm not actually sure how much everyone prepares for tests. As long as you can stay in the top few percent of your year, it's probably enough. By the way, enough is better than perfect, there is no point in maxing out your grades if it means you get to spend less time on extracurriculars. 

Anyway, we are now left with 25 hours. 

Regarding studying for standardized testing (SAT, ACT), many institutions are moving away from test scores, but they still play a partial role in admissions for many schools. Note that higher does not mean better, because to increase your score, you must spend more time studying, which is less time doing more important things. Just get to at least the average of the school you are applying to for your demographic. 

### SAT/ACT Tips
Other than doing practice problem sets, you should also learn the actual concepts the tests are testing. There are so many online guides and tips that people don't look at. Also, for the reading section (where most STEM people lose points), I recommend reading and taking notes on the essays of E.B. White or just any old essays in general to get better at reading comprehension. 

### Clubs
Most schools do care about leadership, so I would recommend joining a few clubs early on that you enjoy, or founding a club you are interested in. Generally, clubs with the following traits are beneficial:

- Competition-based (math, debate, various olympiads)
- Creative (hackathon, art, music, newspaper)
- Outreach with other groups (charity, volunteer, education)
- Project-based (research, graphic design, film)
- Collaborative (orchestra, robotics, esports)

Of course, there can be clubs that fall into many categories, but the point is having something to show off at the end. Although, that's a lie because the actual point is making stuff and doing stuff. It doesn't really matter what you do, as long as you like it and it's cool, it's good. 

If you try to do too much, it could actually harm the quality of what you create. For example, I've always been interested in writing for the school newspaper, but never joined because it requires taking a one-semester journalism course, which seemed very boring. However, if I actually joined, it would take a really long time to actually write articles, which would distract me from my STEM-related pursuits. 

### ECs
Part of the problem with collaborative work is that the individual contribution is unclear. Luckily, there are a lot of random independent projects which can be very valuable. 

## Application Hierarchy
Stepping back for a moment, we have discussed test scores, grades, and extracurriculars.
