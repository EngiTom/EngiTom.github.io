"I cannot see the true face of the mountain because I am within it." —《题西林壁》

## Preface
In June, I made a post of the same name as this one. I said some unfair things about a friend who had ghosted me. On the following day, she reached out and explained everything to me. I believed it and we moved on. On Wednesday, she read the post and got upset with me. 

## Lack of Info
I don't really know the exact reasons why the post made her so upset, but I do have some guesses:
- Publicly writing about her
- Writing about her and me not telling her, kind of a betrayal
- Me being nice while writing bad stuff behind her back
- Misunderstanding what I was saying about our relationship
