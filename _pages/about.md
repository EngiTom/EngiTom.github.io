- writing songs, Tom Zhang on Spotify
- making YT videos about my interests
- solving fun problems (such as, "How similar are the jokes that my teachers make?") with AI
- anime; *Link Click, Jujutsu Kaisen, Detective Conan*, and *Nichijou*
- manga/manhwa; *Greatest Estate Developer*, *Sakamoto Days*, *One Punch Man*, *Manager Kim*, *Lookism*
