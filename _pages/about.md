## Hey there!

My name is Tom Zhang and I am a high school junior from Connecticut, USA. I am very interested in all kinds of STEM topics, mostly centered around computer science, math, data science, and engineering. Expect to see a lot of machine learning notebooks around here...

I'd love to share my advice on school life so feel free to contact me through email. See you around!
