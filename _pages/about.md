## Hey there!

My name is Tom Zhang and I am a 12th grader from Shanghai and Connecticut, USA. In school, I am Math Team captain, Coding Club president, and STEM Journal writer. I attended CMU's SAMS in 2021 and did some physics research at NYU in 2022. 

I'm interested in 
- math, science, and programming, particularly physics 
- playing acoustic guitar and singing
- listening to music (my top 5 fav artists: 李荣浩, 陈奕迅, 关喆, Yorushika, and Feed Me Jack \[although I also like a lot of other stuff\])
- writing songs, 7zh on Spotify
- making YT videos about my interests
- solving fun problems (such as, "How similar are the jokes that my teachers make?") with AI
- anime; I will list a few here: Link Click, Jujutsu Kaisen, Vinland Saga, Kokoro Connect, Shokugeki, Magic Kaito, Detective Conan, and Nichijou
- reading books; I didn't like reading for a long time, but it can be more fulfilling than video games. I highly recommend *Life of Pi* and *Catcher in the Rye*.
- video games: I don't really like video games in general, just Team Fortress 2 and playing some other games with friends (LoL is mostly an exercise in self-control).
- teaching: it's a religious experience to bring faith to others in their ability to learn and reason. 

I love talking with most people so feel free to contact me through Instagram, email, or Discord. See ya!
