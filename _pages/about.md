## Hey there!

My name is Tom Zhang and I am a frosh (freshman) at Caltech. I've lived in Shanghai and Connecticut before. 

I'm interested in 
- CS + science
- playing guitar and singing
- listening to music (my top 5 fav artists: 李荣浩, 陈奕迅, Yorushika, Taylor Swift, and Feed Me Jack)
- writing songs, 7zh on Spotify
- making YT videos about my interests
- solving fun problems (such as, "How similar are the jokes that my teachers make?") with AI
- anime; I will list a few here: *Link Click, Jujutsu Kaisen, Vinland Saga, Kokoro Connect, Magic Kaito, Detective Conan*, and *Nichijou*
- manga/manhwa; *Greatest Estate Developer*, *Sakamoto Days*, *One Punch Man*, *Blue Lock*, *Manager Kim*, *Lookism*
- gaming; TF2, LoL, Civilization 6
- teaching: a lot of fun

I love meeting people so feel free to contact me through Instagram, email, or Discord. See ya!
