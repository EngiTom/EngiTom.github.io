## Hey there!

I'm Tom Zhang, a sophomore at Caltech. Feel free to reach out if you have questions!

I'm interested in 
- adventures
- playing guitar and singing
- music (my top 5 fav artists: 李荣浩, 陈奕迅, Yorushika, Hozier, and Feed Me Jack)
- solving fun problems (such as, "How similar are the jokes that my teachers make?" and "How many chicken nuggets can you buy with X dollars?")
- anime; *Link Click, Jujutsu Kaisen, Detective Conan*, and *Nichijou*
- manga/manhwa; *Greatest Estate Developer*, *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable*, *Sakamoto Days*, *The Last Adventurer*
- TF2, LoL, Valorant
- teaching: something I like
