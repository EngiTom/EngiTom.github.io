## Hey there!

I'm Tom Zhang, a sophomore at Caltech. Feel free to reach out!

I'm interested in 
- solving fun problems (such as, "How similar are the jokes that my teachers make?" and "How many chicken nuggets can you buy with X dollars?")
- playing guitar and singing
- music (my top 5 fav artists: 李荣浩, Yorushika, Hozier, and Feed Me Jack)
- drawing (I love Hirohiko Araki)
- anime; *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable*, *Link Click, Jujutsu Kaisen, Detective Conan*, and *Nichijou*
- manga/manhwa/comics; *Steel Ball Run*, *Team Fortress 2 Comic*, *Greatest Estate Developer*, *Sakamoto Days*, *The Last Adventurer*
- teaching; something I want to do in the future
