        <p>“The hardest thing to do is surpassing yourself.” — Kishibe Rohan</p>

<h2 id="about-japan">About Japan</h2>
<p>Let’s just start with the good and bad of Japan:</p>

<p>Good:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Food</li>
  <li>Prices</li>
  <li>Convenience</li>
  <li>Manners</li>
</ul>

<p>Bad:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No public trash cans</li>
  <li>Public shyness</li>
  <li>Unusual rules</li>
  <li>Too far</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that this post was <strong>mostly written</strong> in July and <em>edited and released</em> in August.</p>

<h2 id="experiences">Experiences</h2>
<p>Since I’m doing an internship in Shanghai this summer, I thought it would be nice to stop in Japan 🗾 for a week and then fly to China .</p>

<p>My great friend Penguin 🐧 let me stay at his house the whole time and planned the entire tour so big thanks to him.</p>

<p>Landing in Tokyo 🗼, we then went to Kyoto ⛩️, Osaka 👺, Hakone ♨️, Okayama 🌊 and then returned to Tokyo 🗼.</p>

<h3 id="places-where-people-shouldnt-be-part-1">Places where people shouldn’t be Part 1</h3>
<p>Penguin recently found out about this e-scooter 🛴 rental app called LUUP so we both installed it and rode them in the Imperial Palace 👑. Well, not <em>in</em> the building, but inside the borders.</p>

<!-- Courtesy of embedresponsively.com //-->

<div class="responsive-video-container">
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/X_OfuZa3xcE" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
  </div>

<p>I didn’t enjoy riding a scooter 🛴 in Tokyo because it’s just so dangerous without bike lanes because the road lanes are so narrow.</p>

<p>That’s something kind of funny about Japan, all of the cars and roads are really tiny. The trucks are the funniest because they look like toys but still end up being a major catalyst for the plots so many animes.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>However, riding a scooter 🛴 inside the palace was super fun.</p>

<h3 id="places-where-people-shouldnt-be-part-2">Places where people shouldn’t be Part 2</h3>
<p>An old classmate of ours, G, joined us when we went to Hakone ♨️ (<strong>the</strong> hot spring town).</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/assets/images/hakone.jpg" alt="alttext">
Hakone Geomuseum</p>

<p>On the way to see a floating Shinto ⛩️ shrine, Penguin told us that we need to take a shortcut if we don’t want to die of exhaustion going the long way round.</p>

<p>So, we <em>jumped a rusty fence</em> and found a really cool <strong>abandoned house</strong>. And after a downhill trek that reminded me of a time that my family got <em>semi-lost</em> on a hike ⛰️, we found where the path collapsed into the water.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/assets/images/fallen.jpg" alt="alttext">
Collapsed road</p>

<p>I don’t think the road actually <em>needed</em> to be closed off ⛔, but I think that Japanese culture seems to have a <strong>deeply embedded fear</strong> of the <strong>ground falling out beneath it</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="earfquake">Earfquake</h3>
<p>Everything from the social programs to the safety regulations seems to suggest a tendency to want to <em>plan things out all the way</em> in order to avoid a <strong>worst-case scenario</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Every</em> subway train gets <strong>taken apart completely every year</strong> and put back together. <em>Every</em> egg 🥚 must be safe to <strong>eat raw</strong>. When 8 of the gym’s 1000 lightbulbs 💡 stop working, they change <em>all</em> 1000 lightbulbs. When an apartment complex’s elevators 🛗 reach 20 years of age, they <em>all</em> get repairs or replacements.</p>

<p>In some ways, this is nice because you know that things will <strong>almost always be fine</strong>, but comes at the cost of being <strong>inefficient</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="elevator-pitch">Elevator Pitch</h3>
<p>It’s interesting because my current Shanghai apartment complex is approximately <strong>23 years old</strong> and <strong>none</strong> of the elevators have been repaired. That’s because the repairs have to come out of an <em>equally-shared fund.</em></p>

<p>However, something interesting occurs when the buildings are of different heights. For example, a <strong>15-story</strong> building’s elevator will <strong><em>break sooner</em></strong> than an <strong>11-story</strong> building’s elevator because the <strong><em>average amount of distance</em></strong> it travels every day is <strong>greater</strong>.</p>

<p>What is fair? <strong>Why should the 11-story building’s residents need to help pay for repairs when their elevator still works decently well?</strong></p>

<h3 id="hot-spring">Hot Spring</h3>
<p>At an inn <em>older than the U.S. Declaration of Independence</em>, Penguin, G, and I had probably the best food of our lives and spilled tea in very nice onsens.</p>

<p>Onsen really is the best place to really spill your guts out if you bring some friends. Penguin was the <strong>main subject of interrogation</strong>, since G and I didn’t know each other that well and Penguin was our only mutual.</p>

<p>However, we did video call 📞 E, another one of our classmates, while he was in NYC. Technically, phones 📵 are not allowed, but there was no one else there, so we brought one anyway.</p>

<h3 id="places-where-people-shouldnt-be-part-3">Places where people shouldn’t be Part 3</h3>
<p>It was at this point that I decided to become a <strong>vlogger</strong> 📹 and started recording a bunch of videos with dynamic transitions so that I could cut 📼 them together later.</p>

<p>We went to this dock in Okayama because we wanted to get a nice shot of the ocean (for a transition) where Penguin and I almost considered <strong>jumping off of a water treatment plant</strong> for a shortcut.</p>

<p>It turns out that we actually headed to a closed-off area which was about 200 meters to the right of an area that we could have gone to. However, we escaped and jumped some fences to get to a <strong>swimming pool</strong>???</p>

<h3 id="places-where-people-shouldnt-be-part-4">Places where people shouldn’t be Part 4</h3>
<p>We went up onto a mountain in Kurishiki, Okayama, the <a href="https://www.japan.travel/en/japan-magazine/exploring-jeans-street-in-kojima-city-dyed-in-indigo/">birthplace of Japanese denim</a> by hiking up a road that got shut down due to a collapsed section (we couldn’t take the bus).</p>

<p>It was kind of surreal because there was <em>nobody</em> for 30 minutes and we were just on the side of a mountain overlooking the ocean.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/assets/images/okayama.jpg" alt="alttext">
Climbing the mountain</p>

<p>When we got to the top, it reminded me a lot of the mountains in Maine: rather smooth, full of pine, and bone coloring. As a result, I believe both landscapes are <a href="https://www.maine.gov/dacf/mgs/explore/surficial/facts/surficial.htm">dominated by erosion</a>.</p>

<h4 id="spirited-away">Spirited Away</h4>
<p>Right on the final stretch as we were about to get back to town past the “Road Closed” sign, <strong>a wild pig 🐗 popped outta the bushes</strong> about 40 meters in front of us and roared.</p>

<p>We froze, and I was considering what to do if it <strong>charges</strong> at us. It <em>didn’t look very big</em>, but I did hear that they can go <em>really</em> fast.</p>

<p>However, she just turned away and crossed the road with her <em>five or six</em> babies (🐖🐖🐖🐖🐖🐖).</p>

<p>Something fascinating is that animals can <em>recognize</em> when humans no longer show up to a location. For example, <em>deer 🦌 get braver</em> when it isn’t hunting season.</p>

<p>The pigs must have realized that <em>those big fast things</em> don’t show up on the road anymore and that it’s now possible for them to eat stuff across the road.</p>

<p><em>Alternatively</em>, they might have <strong>always been crossing</strong> that road<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, just when there weren’t any cars. Who knows?<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="what-the-culture-is-feeling">What the culture is feeling</h2>
<p>Japan is certainly known for its <strong>respectful</strong> culture, but beyond that, there are many more <em>nuances</em> to how things operate.</p>

<h3 id="fashion">Fashion</h3>
<p><strong>Fitting in</strong> is the main focus of Japanese culture, from what I understand.</p>

<p>As a result, everyone tends to wear the same clothes. For example, if you see someone <strong><em>not</em> dressed</strong> in <strong>black</strong> and <strong>white</strong> and <strong>grey</strong>, that person is **probably a tourist. **</p>

<p>Whenever I walked into a restaurant, they <em>immediately</em> ask me what I want to order in <strong>English</strong> instead of <strong>Japanese</strong> because they see I’m wearing <em>purple or blue</em> or some other <strong><em>actual color</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Also, people generally wear <strong>long pants</strong> 👖 even in the summer 😎 because according to Penguin, they do not want to see/show leg hair.</p>

<p>I think another reason is that it’s easier to look taller if you wear long pants because then you can establish a clear <em>40-60 length ratio</em> <strong>above and below the waist</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="supershy">Supershy</h3>
<p>People are really shy and do not enjoy talking in public or seeing other people.</p>

<p>For example, at <strong>Ichiran Ramen</strong>, a very successful ramen 🍜 restaurant, there are single-person seats and you don’t see the cooks or the waiters because there are no waiters and you simply put cards onto a <em>pressure plate</em> at which point the cooks will take the card and bring you the food.</p>

<p>I really don’t enjoy that kind of restaurant because it’s just gone too far. I don’t like to be bothered either but not to the point that I don’t want to see anyone’s face.</p>

<h2 id="no-more-generalizations">No more generalizations</h2>
<p>However, these conclusions are only drawn on the average observations that I’ve observed. In any population, there will be people who deviate from <strong>stereotypes</strong> and it’s <em>important not to</em> <strong>jump to conclusions</strong>.</p>

<p>When I first went to Japan, I felt <strong>uncomfortable</strong> that I was in a <em>new place</em>, but slowly began to <strong><em>identify patterns</em></strong> that helped me feel <strong>accustomed</strong> this foreign land, even if they were wrong.</p>

<p>I don’t think it’s possible to conclude anything too concrete from a two-week trip except that I will definitely be back 🗾.</p>
