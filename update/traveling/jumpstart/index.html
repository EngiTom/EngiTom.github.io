        <p>Reality is made of expectations</p>

<h2 id="caltech">Caltech</h2>
<p>I got into Caltech and I’ve heard that it is pretty hard, especially in the first year, so I was thinking of preparing for it by doing some more calculus problems. However, I don’t think anything can actually help me.</p>

<h2 id="la">LA</h2>
<p>I visited LA over my winter break and it was a lot of fun. I was able to meet one of my online friends at Caltech while I lived at the Athenaeum and walk around, it was a lot of fun! I was lucky to even be able to go because flights from the previous day got canceled due to storms in NYC.</p>

<h3 id="food">Food</h3>
<p>LA probably has one of the best Asian food scenes in the world, especially the dim sum places and Japanese places. Pretty sure all I did in California was sleep, walk, and eat.</p>

<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>
<p>Other than Caltech, I went to the Getty Art Museum, Huntington Museum/Garden/Library, and Hollywood. My family decided not to visit Disney or Universal Studios because it is smaller than the ones in Florida and my sister and I are a bit too old.</p>

<h2 id="san-diego">San Diego</h2>
<p>San Diego is quite a far drive from LA, so I don’t think I will visit it much in the future.</p>

<h3 id="food-1">Food</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, there were no In-N-Outs near the hotel at La Jolla, so I was unable to eat that. The restaurants weren’t nearly as good as LA’s, but maybe I just didn’t find the right ones. It may be a lack of competition that caused the drop in taste.</p>

<h3 id="locations-1">Locations</h3>
<p>There weren’t that many places that I went to. La Jolla was probably second best, while the park near the San Diego Zoo was probably the best area. There was a Japanese garden, but it was quite lackluster compared to the one at Huntington.</p>

<p>Overall, I think that this trip got me some nice blubber (like a seal), but I definitely need to continue to get fitter now that I am back home.</p>

<h2 id="habit-of-unfocus">Habit of Unfocus</h2>
<p>I’ve noticed recently that I misread words more often, which is very strange. Also, I become unfocused or forgetful of things that I should focus on. I’m not sure why this happens, but it might be that I am not getting enough sleep.</p>

<h3 id="memo-booklets">Memo booklets</h3>
<p>I bought some mini notepads in LA, and I’ve been using them a little bit in order to keep track of what happens throughout the day. I don’t really like using them as journals because I only get to write a couple things and I generally like to go into detail, but I think that they are good for solving problems on the fly.</p>

<h2 id="laughing">Laughing</h2>
<p>Occassionally, I can be seen smiling or laughing a lot more than other people. This is because I find certain ordinary things funny.</p>

<h3 id="funny-misunderstanding">Funny Misunderstanding</h3>
<p>In AP CSP, which I am an assistant teacher in, there is a student in the front row who is close to a model student, other than how she sometimes misunderstands concepts. However, I believe that a model student does not need to do everything correctly or be very smart, but rather tries their best to learn more even if they do not understand.</p>

<p>Anyway, today we were learning about logic gates, and she could not understand why the OR gate’s truth table was TRUE when the inputs were both TRUE. I think that this was just some sort of fundamental misunderstanding, and that she would need to learn it from the basic idea of what a logic gate does.</p>

<p>Where it gets funny is that she was trying so many times even though she misunderstood every time, and I was smiling and laughing a bit toooo much. Her eyes were sort of saying, “Please don’t laugh :(“ because she thought I was laughing because I thought she was dumb. I should clarify that tomorrow, since, at the end of class, she said to her friend something approximating, “omg this class makes me feel so dumb,” which I probably had a part in.</p>

<p>Either way, I think this misunderstanding of misunderstandings is pretty funny.</p>

<h2 id="9001-takes">9001 Takes</h2>
<p>I keep recording videos and then immediately deleting them because I just don’t feel satisfied with them for some reason.</p>

<h3 id="civilization">Civilization</h3>
<p>When I record Civ 6, I try to discuss some personal stuff like I would do in a TF2 gameplay commentary, but Civ takes up so much attention that I just end up talking about the game.</p>

<p>When I try to record a tutorial for Civ 6 (even though I am not that good), I end up playing for too long continuously and then just giving up after a few mistakes.</p>

<h3 id="college">College</h3>
<p>Something I joke about is how I’m just going to become a “College Youtuber/Vlogger” but I do find the idea of making videos helping people applying to be a good use of time. However, I am not the type to write a script for videos where I just use MS Paint and a webcam, so I either end up talking for too long about something or I end up saying, “Umm, what was I talking about again?” too much because of the earlier point about my lack of focus.</p>

<p>Sometimes, a concept comes into my brain and then disappears, which feels really bad.</p>

<p>A list some concepts I want to include in videos:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Timeline starting from 9th grade</li>
  <li>Timeline starting from 11th grade May 15th</li>
  <li>How to pick essay topic</li>
  <li>How to answer questions</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-moment-has-passed">The Moment Has Passed</h2>
<p>Well, December break has ended, and the next break is in February, so I hope that I can keep going until then.</p>

<p>Some work I haven’t done yet:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Presentation for my Finance + NLP project</li>
  <li>Reading bioinformatics papers about antibody design</li>
  <li>January Inklings ChatGPT article</li>
  <li>Editing my AP Lit paper</li>
  <li>Economics paper</li>
  <li>Economics practice</li>
</ul>

<p>Soooo… Work time!</p>
