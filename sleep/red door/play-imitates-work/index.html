        <p>“All of these stars are actually shining just for you.” — <em>The Boxer</em></p>

<h2 id="sleep">Sleep</h2>
<p>I used to think that it was crazy that humans sleep an average of eight hours per day, which adds up to be 1/3 of a lifetime. Spending 33% of the time not doing anything still seems kind of crazy to me.</p>

<p>My rationale was that if I just slept for six hours a day, then I would get to spend 75% of my life being conscious, which is more than 67%.</p>

<h3 id="i-met-a-traveler-from-an-antique-land">I met a traveler from an antique land…<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>
</h3>
<p>I remember Mr. P once said that sleep is more important than staying up to do homework, a statement I accepted without application.</p>

<p>There are definitely health benefits of all kind, including recovering from sickness and injuries and improved memory and focus.</p>

<p>However, I could never feel a big difference between sleeping different amounts of time. There’s a small difference in the dread of needing to get outta bed, but it’s not even close to the difference between eating ice cream and vegetables.</p>

<h3 id="half-sunk-a-shattered-visage-lies">Half sunk, a shattered visage lies…</h3>
<p>Red Door Cafe is open from 7 AM to 2 AM on weekdays and 3 PM to 2 AM on weekends (different on holidays).</p>

<p>Last night, I went at around 12:30 AM to get an <strong>Orange</strong>, but the cashier thought I said <strong>Corndog</strong>, which was pretty funny.</p>

<p>This afternoon, I went again and noticed that the cashier’s reaction time was much faster compared to last night and there were no errors.</p>

<p>I also noticed that the cooks/baristas get orders wrong more often at night, like making a hot chocolate instead of a latte or something like that.</p>

<p>So, even though I didn’t notice those effects taking place on me, it’s still possible to see it happen to others.</p>

<h2 id="___">___</h2>
<p>I recently had lunch with Professor Adam Blank (they/them), who teaches CS 2, and a few of my friends.</p>

<h3 id="da-rulez">Da Rulez</h3>
<p>In CS 2, if a student hands in homework early, they get a number of <strong>grace points</strong> equal to the number of days early.</p>

<p>A group of six students can exchange seven grace points each for a lunch or dinner at the Athenaeum (Caltech alumni club hotel/restaurant) with Adam.</p>

<p>Apparently we were the second group of CS 2 students to ever exchange for a lunch (the first in years), which seems kind of weird, why wouldn’t people want to eat good food?</p>

<h3 id="sat">SAT</h3>
<p>In Ch 1b, Professor Hosea asked us about whether admissions should look at SAT score, and the people who answered in class all said no. However, I feel like the pressure to say no during the lecture in front of the entire grade is way too high, which definitely resulted in a biased sample.</p>

<p>Adam said that it’s complicated, but they believe that it should only be used as a basic bar set at ~650 for math. This was also the conclusion I reached because every point raised shrinks the number of applicants and the talent diversity exponentially.</p>

<p>For example, if you only take 780 and above for math, then you will only have 2% eligible. Now, add more axes for desirable traits like creativity, curiosity, common-sense, kindness, etc. In the end, the likelihood of capturing a group that’s closest to the average full score is not going to be helped by only taking 2% of the population.</p>

<h3 id="education">Education</h3>
<p>Adam went to undergrad at Carnegie Mellon and then dropped out of grad school for health reasons, but was accepted to be a professor anyway. This is probably because of all the TAing experience they got by just enjoying the process.</p>

<p>In that way, we are similar, so I might take CS 101 in the spring, a new class Adam is teaching so that students will be prepared to be a TA for CS 2.</p>

<h2 id="life-imitates-art">“Life imitates Art</h2>
<p>far more than Art imitates Life.” — Oscar Wilde</p>

<p>Today, I went to my first art class at Caltech. I emailed the teacher, Jim Barry, who told me to just come check it out.</p>

<p>I am signed up to take PVA 062C: Drawing and Painting next semester, giving me a total of 51 units.</p>

<h3 id="spring-schedule">Spring Schedule</h3>
<p>My schedule for next term is:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Math 1c practical (9 units)</li>
  <li>Phys 1c analytical (9 units)</li>
  <li>CS 3 (9 units)</li>
  <li>Geology 1 (9 units)</li>
  <li>Humanities (9 units)</li>
  <li>CS 101 (3 units)</li>
  <li>PVA 062C Drawing and Painting (3 units)</li>
</ol>

<p>CS 101 and PVA 062C should be fun.</p>

<h3 id="the-drawing-board">The drawing board</h3>
<p>Jim told me to come by at 7 PM to check out the vibes and I sort of liked it even though I didn’t know anyone there.</p>

<p>The art classes don’t have any instructions or assignments, it’s just whatever people want to work on. For me, I want to learn sketching so that I can draw people to show off.</p>

<p>Jim showed me a few books on sketching figures (bodies) and I got through the first few pages of the one he recommended.</p>

<h3 id="why-so-serious">Why So Serious?</h3>
<p>When he walked by, he noticed (through his artist’s eye) that I was touching my face/head in a way that expressed a negative emotion associated with working.</p>

<p>He said, “Don’t make it into work,” which was something I didn’t really want to hear but I definitely needed to hear.</p>

<p>I was treating art as if it were a subject of study, like math and physics. I was reading the textbook and doing example problems, taking notes.</p>

<h3 id="back-to-the-drawing-board">Back to the drawing board…</h3>
<p>I don’t even read the textbook or take notes for math or physics, so it’s a strange kind of juxtaposition.</p>

<p>Perhaps I associate a desire for something with working hard for it, and I simply don’t desire to be good at math and physics as much as I currently desire to be better at art.</p>

<p>However, the real problem is that I don’t have enough fun when I do math and physics. I am not enjoying the process of learning even though that’s what turns work into play.</p>

<h3 id="they-come-in-pairs">They come in pairs</h3>
<p>Jim offered me some candy from a big jar while stating, “<strong>They come in pairs.</strong>”</p>

<p>I took three small jawbreakers, which were called dopplers or something, but Jim stopped me and repeated, “<strong>They come in pairs.</strong>”</p>

<p>So, I took a lollipop. Then, he poured me a cup of hot chocolate, which was actually really good. I think there’s cinnamon in it or some kind of apple spice.</p>

<h3 id="but-i-dont-know-how-to-draw">…but I don’t know how to draw…<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>
</h3>
<p>The main purpose of that class is for relaxation, which is something I need to realize. And although I would like to learn some techniques from a teacher, I would also like to have fun, and I’ve never really had fun in a tutoring format.</p>

<p>I always hated piano and swim lessons (and art lessons). The only time I’ve liked things are when I learned them on my own for fun.</p>

<h3 id="what-other-people-think">What other people think</h3>
<p>There is also a nude model that comes in every class at around 8:30 PM<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> and poses in the basement. I did not go to the basement this time, but I figured I would go next time. If I were Feynman, I would have gone to see the model today and written about it in this post<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, but I hesitated for some reason.</p>

<p>However, I will have plenty of opportunities next semester, or this semester when I go visit again. Jim said if I weren’t able to take the class next semester, I could just go this semester every Wednesday and perhaps I could get credit for it. I would go even if I didn’t get credit!</p>

<h3 id="so-youll-have-to-do-the-drawing">…so you’ll have to do the drawing.</h3>
<p>In the middle, I texted my friend C that I was learning to draw. She was very supportive (“OH LFG”) and asked me to send pictures. Also, I often send Kirby memes, so she said that I should “DRAW sm [some] KIRBY.”</p>

<p>I gave Kirby an uncanny human face and she said “that’s crazy,” which was super funny. I could have done better though.</p>

<h2 id="play-imitates-work">Play imitates work<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>
</h2>
<p>If I project my enjoyment of art into the future using my method of taking notes and working super hard every class, I will eventually stop coming because I would find it tedious.</p>

<p>The same is probably true for math and science. If I don’t find a way to enjoy them, I’m going to end up quitting. I need to make it fun for me.</p>

<p>Play imitates Work far more than Work imitates Play, the opposite of what should happen!</p>

<h2 id="chipotle">Chipotle</h2>
<p>is pretty good, I had it for the first time today with A, W, G, O, C, and a guy I forgot the name of.</p>

<h3 id="zankou-chicken">Zankou Chicken</h3>
<p>I heard good things about Zankou Chicken, a sort of fast food restaurant near Afters Ice Cream, but I tried it tonight before art class and I don’t think it lived up to the hype. I would rather eat at Cluck2Go if I were going to have that type of meal with just chicken and some other stuff.</p>

<p>They have a giant mirror on one wall so it looks like the inside is twice as big. I was actually wondering, “Why are there two lines for ordering food?” until I realized there was a mirror.</p>

<p>If this were <em>Diary of a Wimpy Kid</em>, I could walk into the mirror and fall over, suing the restaurant for a lot of money.</p>
